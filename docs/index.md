# Highlighted Java Projects 

### [Quotes](https://github.com/apreston26/quotes/tree/master/app/src/main/java/edu/cnm/deepdive/quotes)
This a little app we made that shows a list of quotes on our phone screen on an infinite scroll viewmodel. It also includes the ability for the user to change the quote and the source. 
    
### [Animals](https://github.com/apreston26/animals/tree/master/app/src/main/java/edu/cnm/deepdive/animals)
In this app it gets pictures of animals from an [API](https://us-central1-apis-4674e.cloudfunctions.net/) and uses a spinner in the app to allow the user to choose which animal they want to look at.

### [Quotes Service](https://github.com/apreston26/quotes-service/tree/master/src/main/java/edu/cnm/deepdive/quotes)
Unlike the others this a project we made that works as a database and can be used as a functional localhost website. 

### [Dice Solitaire](https://github.com/apreston26/dice-solitatire/tree/master/app/src/main/java/edu/cnm/deepdive/dicesolitatire)
This is a slightly complex game where we implemented an animation for dice rolls, and a way to show dice images.

# My Personal Android Project 
In the deepdive coding bootcamp every student is required to make their own personal android app. For my project I went to make a maintenance app that helps users keep track of all the maintenance on their car.

### [Maintenance Checker](https://apreston26.github.io/maintence-checker/)
### [Wireframe](Pwireframe.md)
### [ERD](PERD.md)

# My Capstone Project 
Also in this program all of the students are assigned into groups to work on these Capstone projects which all are required to implement server components. In my group's project we wanted an outdoorsy feel and wanted to make an app that not only showed of nearby campsites and trails, but also told you what you needed to bring depending on which campsite or trail you were going to.

### [Trail Masters](https://nm-trailmaster.github.io/)
### [Server Component](https://github.com/nm-trailmaster/trailmaster-service/tree/master/src/main/java/edu/cnm/deepdive/trailmasterservice/)
### [Wireframe](Cwireframe.md)
### [ERD](Cerd.md)

# The Beginning to my C++ Journey 

### [BullCowGame](https://github.com/apreston26/BullCowGame)
This is a very simple text-based game where the player has to guess the isogram which is a word with no repeating letters. As you guess words the game gives the player either bulls or cows. If you get a bull you have a correct letter and in the right position and if you get a cow you have a correct letter but in the wrong position.

### [TripleX](https://github.com/apreston26/TripleX)
Again another very simple text-based game where the player has to guess three numbers in order to crack the lock using simple mathematics and progress to the next lock.

# Miscellaneous Coding Achievements 

* Worked at Sandia National Laboratories and helped make critical SQL queries. 
* Was introduced to the C language while helping a teacher build scorpion robot as a school mascot.
* Taught myself how to 3D model.
